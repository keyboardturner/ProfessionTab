#THIS ADDON IS IN ALHPA. EXPECT THINGS TO GO WRONG.

If you are using Curse Client, make sure to set the "Preferred Release Type" to "Alpha" on this addon.
(Right click the addon in the Curse Client.)

ProfessionTab makes it easier to get to your professions and keep them orderly. By default, you have to open the spell book, click on the profession, and then have to close the spell book again because it takes up too much space and clutters the screen. I aim to keep this as light weight as possible without replacing any frames entirely. This is still a rough work in progress. I'm a novice addon developer, and I really want help making this a better addon as well as improve the quality of life of the default game UI. :) (Currently as of right now, I have not make the tabs convert into any Skin-replacement addons (Such as Skinner and ElvUI), however I am working on that.

Why did I make this addon? I was tired of all of the clicks I had to do to get to the profession tab. Does it make me lazy? Probably. I want to make professions feel immersive, and I don't enjoy having to open several windows all the time just to craft a simple potion or hammer some metal.

This addon has Cloudy TradeSkill built in. Go support him!

To do list:

Fix up the code and learn Lua better. I know, mine is pretty rough.
Make it so when you press "K" for professions, it will redirect you to the TradeSkill Frame instead of bring the default tab.
Add Archaeology in a better way. Right now, it can only be accessed by pressing "K."
Known Issuse: For some reason, when switching back to the spell book, the tabs look weird. They're still fully functional, though. When I figure out what's causing that, I will fix it immediately.
